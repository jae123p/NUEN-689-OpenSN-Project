# NUEN-689-OpenSN-Project
OpenSN Project for Joseph Park

Goal of the project is to conduct a criticality benchmark using Open-SN, and comparing with criticality benchmarks from "An Expanded Criticality Validation Suite for MCNP" by Russell D. Mosteller. In the document, there exists benchmarks for different testcases, and the benchmark k_effective value as well as the k_effective value generated by MCNP for that test case. This project in particular looks at cases 1 through 12 of heu-met-fast-003, and looks at the different k_effective values generated by OpenMC and Open-SN to that listed in the document.
